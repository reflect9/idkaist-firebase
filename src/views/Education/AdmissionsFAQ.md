# Master & PhD Admission FAQ

## Q1. What do graduate students at IDKAIST do?
>KAIST is a research-oriented university, meaning that graduate students at IDKAIST are both students and researchers. They take classes as well as work full time at their lab performing research with the help of their advisors and colleagues. Initially, academics make up a greater portion, but research for their own dissertations and industrial/government projects will gradually take up a greater part of their learning at IDKAST. They sometimes stay at the labs carrying out their research duties, especially when their degree topics are aligned to the projects. Students are motivated to invest their extra time.

## Q2. What courses do graduate students at IDKAIST take?

## Q3. What are the labs at IDKAIST and what kind of research do graduate students at each lab perform?
>Learning at a research focused graduate program takes place not just in class but also in the process of performing research for contract projects and dissertations. A wide range of unique research traversing the boundaries of science and design is being conducted at our labs. There are currently 14 labs led by 14 professors at IDKAIST.

## Q5. What do graduate students of IDKAIST do after they graduate?
>Master's graduates go on to design roles or research roles related to design. They may develop new products with consideration for user experience or conduct trend research or user research for design development at large IT companies, startups, and design firms. PhD graduates pursue their design career in industries, academia, research organizations, and public institutions. The specific field varies widely depending on the topic of PhD research.
>
>Currently, most of our PhD graduates work in new product development or user experience research at large companies or help bridge design education and research at universities. Some graduates are in charge of design review at public institutions such as the Korean Intellectual Property Office or perform human centered design research at IT research institutes. Others have gone on to become CEOs or CDRs at startups.

## Q6. Can I apply to IDKAIST even if I did not major in design?
>IDKAIST welcomes those who have majored in engineering fields such as Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Industrial Science, and Human Engineering. Applicants who combine an understanding of design with fundamental engineering knowledge have the potential to become outstanding graduate students. Such applicants would have to prepare application documents and interviews that display their expertise in their original majors, as well as their goals and plans for interdisciplinary design research. 

## Q7. Can I apply to IDKAIST even if I did not major in engineering?
>IDKAIST welcomes applicants with not only skills related to the final product of design such as product development, visual media, spatial systems, etc., but also those related to the value provided by design such as visual communication, user experience, and services. Applicants with a background in design can combine their knowledge with systematic research methodology and new technologies to create synergy. Such applicants would also have to prepare application documents and interviews that display their expertise in their original majors, as well as their goals and plans for interdisciplinary design research. 

## Q8. My educational background is far from engineering. Am I going to have a problem to follow the IDKAIST curriculum?
>Having an engineering background could be helpful in one aspect. However, in principle, IDKAIST does appreciate diverse expertise from different disciplines. Almost every year, we have graduate students who majored neither design nor engineering, but show their excellence in both courses and research achievement. If you plan to take technology-intensive courses, then you need to put extra efforts just because it is new to you.

## Q9. How do graduate students at IDKAIST choose their own labs?
>For MS candidates, the Department offers new students introductory presentations and tours of all research labs before the first semester. Based on the information collected from the orientation, students apply to a few labs in prioritized order. Individual interviews with professors proceed after the applications. Department discusses the best matches and announce the result to students. 
>
>Ph.D. applicants assign their potential supervisors in application forms. The accepted applicants are matched to the supervisors in most cases, but those who have not yet decided for supervisor specifically still can apply. In this case, the Head of Department should be an advisor tentatively. Based on the applicant’s research interest, the actual supervisor will be searched and matched after the admission.
## Q10. Who do I contact for inquiries about applying to the graduate program at IDKAIST?
>For general inquiries regarding the overall admissions process, schedule, and document submission, please contact the Graduate School Admissions Team at the Office of Admissions (042-350-2351, advanced.adm@kaist.ac.kr).
